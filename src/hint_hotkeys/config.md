Hint Hotkeys supports the following config values:

- `hotkey_reveal_one` (text): Hotkey that triggers revealing hints one-by-one. Default: `H`.
- `hotkey_reveal_all` (text): Hotkey that triggers revealing all hints at once. Default: `G`.

To set the hotkey to a key combination, simply use a `+` to describe the combination, e.g. `Shift+H`. A key combination may only contain one regular key (e.g. `H`) at a time, but you can combine multiple keyboard modifiers (e.g. `Shift+Ctrl+Alt+H`).

**To apply changes to your hotkeys please go back to Anki's main screen and then start reviewing cards again.**
